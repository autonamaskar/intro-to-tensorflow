# Intro to Tensorflow
Here you can read about my first interacion with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). More or less, it is my playground to learn more about the library.

# Prerequisites

To run this project, you need [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installed(please visit [this link](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) for quick installation instructions.)

# Installation
To create an environment for this project use the following command:

```
conda create --name=IntroToTensorFlow python=3 anaconda
```

Activate your new environment:

```
source activate IntroToTensorFlow
```

And install TensorFlow:

```
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```

Everything done, you can start Jupyter and start playing with it:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will opens a browser with Jupyter on the current directory.
